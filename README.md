# Week-01 WP Welcome User

### Discord WordPress Weekly Challenge

Make a logged in user feel welcome to your site! Customize their experience when they first log in with something personalized.


#### Description
This plugin will remove all of the default dashboard widgets and the default welcome screen, then allow you to add your own.

#### Features and Usage
This plugin provides a custom welcome panel, but it is meant to just be a placeholder. You can make it your own by copying "user-dash-welcome-panel.php" to your theme, then modifying it.

This plugin also adds two widget areas to the user dashboard so you can add any widgets you want by going to Appearance->Widgets in the admin area.
